# SchoolMngtDB_System
This is a final school project that I work on my database programming class.


Design a database system to support any number of school in an area (e.g. School District, Town, or City). 

The entities should include, Attendance, Classes, Parents, Schools, Students, and Teachers.

1. Write the business rule(s) that govern the relationship between the entities.
2. Given the business rule(s) you wrote in Step 1, create a Crowâ€™s Foot ERD. Do not use your free hand to create the ERD.
3. Determine the characteristics of each entity (Attributes).
4. Identify the Primary and Foreign keys and any other constraints for each entity.
5. Make sure they are in 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.
6. Write DDLs, in a file, to create tables for your database and populate them.
